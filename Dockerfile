# Google Music Manager works on Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and OpenSuSE.  Choose
# Ubuntu because it has good LTS images and, as the most popular Linux desktop,
# Music Manager is more likely to run best on it.
FROM ubuntu

# Download and install the google-musicmanager package directly, with
# dependencies.  This is done as opposed to configuring the Google apt
# repositories and getting it through the package manager, which is not
# documented and seems to suffer from some invalid metadata issues.

# Set up links so the program can find its config and default music source
# out-of-the-box while being user-friendly from the docker side.  These are not
# explicitly exposed as "volumes" so that Docker doesn't create empty
# directories for them.  I'd rather Music Manager fail than to write its config
# to a directory that the user forgot to map in to the container.

# The google-musicmanager process daemonizes itself with no option to run in in
# the foreground, so wrap it to wait for the daemon process to exit, and pass a
# couple signals around.

# Run google-musicmanager with the wrapper and have it find our music volume.
